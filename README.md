Hi, Iâ€™m @LeoTheMoldyLemon,
I'm a highschooler currently learning C# by working on a project for the Croatian Misnisty of Upbringing and Education.
I'm using Xamarin to create an app that will register children's arrival and departure from kindergarten and will send messages upon the child leaving or not arriving in the facility.
